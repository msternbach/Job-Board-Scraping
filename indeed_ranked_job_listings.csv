chief medical officer,every cure,"hybrid remote in new york, ny",,"the every cure team: every cure is a start-up, nonprofit drug development organization on a mission to alleviate suffering for the ~300 million people worldwide battling diseases without fda-approved treatments by unlocking hidden cures. we are building a first-of-its-kind, ai-powered platform to identify fda-approved treatments that can be repurposed for untreated diseases. inspired by our success in repurposing over a dozen drugs for new uses, including one that is saving dr. david fajgenbaum's own life, we are committed to unlocking the full potential of fda-approved drugs to treat every disease and patient possible. our groundbreaking approach revolves around building an open-source database and employing cutting-edge tools to identify drug repurposing opportunities. since launching at the 2022 clinton global initiative, we have received tremendous media attention and recognition including the 2023 elevate prize foundation founder's award, attracted leaders from across industries, been invited to share about our work at the white house, aspen ideas, and a congressional caucus briefing, and demonstrated the life-saving potential of our platform. four strategic pillars guide our efforts:using an ai engine to identify promising drug repurposing opportunities.prioritizing high-impact opportunities which affect neglected patient communities.efficiently validating promising opportunities through laboratory and clinical studies.ensuring everyone has equitable access to new cures.as a nonprofit organization, we are able to focus on maximizing patient impact and saving lives without needing to consider the commercial viability of drugs, including the 80% that are already generic and completely neglected. our team, comprising experts in drug discovery, data analysis, and clinical trials, collaborates with entities ranging from philanthropic organizations to biopharmaceutical industries including chan zuckerberg initiative, flagship pioneering, clinton global initiative, elevate prize foundation, and lyda hill philanthropies, among others. the every cure team is expanding rapidly and seeking top-notch, purpose-driven professionals to perform a range of tasks to save lives with hidden cures. this is a unique opportunity to join a highly motivated, patient-focused team based in philadelphia, pa and new york city that works closely with international collaborators, government agencies, academic researchers, philanthropic organizations, and biopharmaceutical companies to make a significant impact on patients with major unmet medical needs.job summary: the chief medical officer (cmo) holds a pivotal leadership role within every cure, reporting directly to the ceo. the cmo's primary responsibility is to select the most promising drug repurposing opportunities derived from computational approaches and external engagements then develop and execute plans for evaluating these opportunities through clinical trials. the cmo also works closely with the organization's cto to develop the data strategy, ensuring that medical and biological rationales are embedded in the data science approach. leveraging their medical background and knowledge, the cmo collaborates with data science and research teams to shape data mining algorithms and data analysis methodologies. once machine learning results are produced, the cmo leads the evaluation of the leading hypotheses to prioritize opportunities, establish development plans for the most promising opportunities, and lead the advancement of these drugs through clinical trials and clinical use. by integrating medical knowledge with data science strategies, the cmo will identify potential drug candidates and increase the success rate of clinical trials. the cmo will also support the build out of additional scoring systems beyond efficacy, such as the impact of the treatment. the cmo will work closely with the cto to generate impact scores for all drugs vs all diseases as well as to oversee preclinical/laboratory validation. lastly, the cmo will oversee ""dream teams"" being set up by the organization to pursue disease specific projects (e.g., long covid). the cmo also ensures appropriate medical governance and compliance across the organization. the cmo plays a critical role in advancing drug repurposing initiatives and transforming data-driven research into impactful clinical outcomes for patients. the chief medical officer's (cmo) scope of responsibilities spans across data strategy development and collaboration with technical experts, selection and development of advancement plans for promising drug repurposing opportunities, and clinical trial execution. the cmo's contributions have a significant impact on the organization's ability to leverage medical expertise in data-driven drug repurposing research and changing clinical practice. by designing and executing development plans for promising drug repurposing opportunities, the cmo directly unlocks new treatments, contributing to advancements in healthcare, and improving patient outcomes. the cmo will be at the cutting edge of the development of a new field of science we have named ""pharmaco-phenotyping"" – using data to map the complex connection between drugs and disease.work location:   our work is
