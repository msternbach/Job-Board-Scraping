Being able to discuss examples of having a measurable impact on the business and mastering new technologies would show how you are focused on making a difference for the team and the company. Keeping things simple – someone who remains focused on simple, reliable solutions even when the problems seem complex. We’d love to hear precedents where you took something really complicated and were able solve it with something simple, or in a way that addressed an even bigger problem in a general, flexible way. And as potential bonus areas, we’re also interested to hear about yourMore in-depth previous experience in healthcare or with healthcare informatics/analytics, demonstrating in-depth knowledge of healthcare industry and terminology Breadth of data skills across the board with knowledge of infrastructures (in Snowflake, AWS), data modeling, reporting & visualizations, statistics/analytics, AI/ML, Jupyter notesbooks, etc – we’re still a small team and being able to demonstrate breadth of knowledge is as important as demonstrating depth.
