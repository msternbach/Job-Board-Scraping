While the problems we solve at SIG are often different from academia, our problems demand the attention of brilliant minds that have an extraordinary attention to detail and a relentless pursuit of understanding.\\n\\nThe general lifecycle of a quant project begins with an idea:\\n\\n This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria. \\n As a Quantitative Researcher , you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming. \\n Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal. \\n You will work side-by-side with technologists in order to backtest your results and put that trading signal into production. \\n Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will continue to do research on that strategy in order to optimize its performance. \\n As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas. \\n Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again. \\n\\nWe have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.\\n\\nWhat We're Looking For\\n\\n PhD in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics \\n Exceptional mathematical problem-solving skills \\n Strong communication skills in a fast-paced and/or highly collaborative environment are essential \\n Strong, practical computing skills; a specific language proficiency is less important than your ability to get computers to accomplish tasks efficiently and reliably \\n Experience working on in-depth research projects \\n Finance experience is not a requirement \\n\\nBy applying to this role, you will be automatically considered for the Quantitative Systematic Trader position. There is no need to apply to both positions in order to be considered for both.\\n\\nVisa sponsorship is available for this position.\\n\\nThe annual base pay range for this role is $200,000 - $225,000 + discretionary bonus + benefits. SIG considers factors such as scope and responsibilities of the position, work experience, education/training, key skills, as well as market and organizational considerations when extending an offer.\\n\\nSIG does not accept unsolicited resumes from recruiters or search firms. Any resume or referral submitted in the absence of a signed agreement will become the property of SIG and no fee will be paid.\\n\\nFT23\", 'About the job\\nAbout Agoda\\n\\nAgoda is an online travel booking platform for accommodations, flights, and more.

Unfortunately, scammers may attempt to impersonate our company to deceive individuals seeking employment. We take this matter seriously and want to ensure your job search with us is free from any fraudulent activity.\\nIntegra Connect has become aware of recent, fraudulent recruitment activity being conducted by individuals or groups who claim to be third party recruiters and/or points of contact for our Company. Examples include sending candidates a request for personal information, conducting online interviews or meetings, making offers of employment, demanding money for employment related services and activities, or asking the applicant to purchase a laptop or other work-related equipment for the job. The aim of the fraud is to obtain personally identifying information (e.g., identity theft) and/or money. The Company’s name, as well as the names of employees, are used to try to convey authenticity.\\nHere are some tips to help you identify and avoid job scams:\\n1. Always Check the Source:\\nEnsure that the job listing is on our official website or a reputable job board. Our official domain is https://www.integraconnect.com/resources/careers/. Be cautious of unsolicited emails, text messages, or social media messages offering job opportunities.\\n2. Be Wary of Requests for Personal Information:\\nWe will never request sensitive personal information like your Social Security number, bank details, or payment for onboarding/equipment. If you encounter such requests, it's likely a scam.\\n3. Verify Contact Information:\\nCheck that the contact information provided in the job posting, including email addresses and phone numbers, aligns with our official contact information. Scammers often use generic or non-company email addresses.\\nWhat is the sender’s email address? Is it consistent with other job postings from this company? Email addresses that are slightly different from any business’s primary contact information (Jane.Doe@IntegraConnect.org vs John.Doe@Integra Connect.com) are a common warning sign.\\nIf you are contacted through LinkedIn, be sure to review the entire profile to verify their credentials.\\nIf you suspect that a job offer is fraudulent, we recommend that you do not respond to it.\\nIf you believe you are the victim of any fraudulent activity, you can report it to the appropriate authorities at https://www.myfloridalegal.com/consumer-protection/how-to-protect-yourself-job-listing-and-job-search-firms (Florida Department of State) and/or https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/job-scams#report (U.S. Federal Trade Commission).\\nIntegra Connect is not responsible for any fraudulent offers and advises prospective candidates to follow the guidance provided above.\\nThank you for your interest in a career with Integra Connect.
