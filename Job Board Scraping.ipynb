We partner with primary care providers to improve the engagement and management of their Medicaid patients, providing independent practices access to specialized resources and clinical programs to address medical, social and behavioral patient needs. Our care ecosystem is equipped with enhanced technology and data interfaces to enable provider and patient success in a value-based environment. Guided by our core values of humility, continuous learning and feeling the weight, our team is on a mission to strengthen communities from within, unlocking people's ability to live their healthiest lives.\\n\\nWe are looking for a Healthcare Data Scientist to join our team! This is a highly visible role on our growing team, who will help pioneer and grow advanced analytic capabilities in healthcare as we work to improve care for the disadvantaged. This role reports directly to the Senior Vice President, Technology.\\n\\nWho We Are\\n\\nWe are a team of entrepreneurs passionate about improving health access and outcomes for those most in need. Diverge Health supports primary care practices to extend their reach and better serve patients on Medicaid. We bring providers significant infrastructure - contracts, local community health teams, provider liaisons, enabling technology and data – to improve outcomes for low-income patients, and enable success in value-based contracts.\\n\\nOur technology organization is a small, growing team of problem solvers committed to improving healthcare outcomes for key disadvantaged populations. Our fully remote, entrepreneurial workforce strives to be…\\n\\nInnovative – We love creative problem solvers capable of outside the box solutioning, and who work hard to find simple solutions to hard problems. \\nIndependent – We take ownership of problems and have pride in our solutions, while working independently and supporting each other’s efforts. \\nAdaptive – As a small team, we all lean in across the breadth of our technologies and love to learn new technologies and dive into new areas - and to figure things out as we go. \\n\\nWhat We Do\\n\\nWe create and execute our technology enablement efforts – from software development to data/analytics, to infrastructure, and enterprise technologies. We work collaboratively across internal stakeholders to understand business problems and needs, and design & implement solutions that support our mission of providing effective and transformative patient-centered care.\\n\\nOur data scientists team leverages integrations with all types of healthcare data - claims data, electronic health/medical records, healthcare information exchanges, continuity of care information, admit/discharge records, etc – to help identify patients that would benefit most from focused care efforts, and uses data to help shape the plans that offer care to this population. We leverage census and other population data to locate where such populations exist and are centered so that services can be effectively offered to large populations. We work to continually shape and improve healthcare so that it becomes both more effective and more cost-effective by analyzing clinical results and feeding that into future strategies.\\n\\nWe leverage a collection of cloud-based tools to store, analyze, and report within our data efforts. Our team members might leverage Snowflake to store vast SQL databases – defining data models thru dbt and integrations thru Hightouch or Dagster. Or they may leverage reporting capabilities of Sigma, Salesforce, or more to visualize results. They can leverage advanced databases of AWS such as Dynamo for NoSQL or Neptune for relational queries, and use the cloud for complex AI calculations with Jupyter notebooks in Sagemaker or other machine learning platforms.\\n\\nHow You Can Help Us\\n\\nHere are some key areas where we’re looking to make our team stronger:\\n\\nKnowledge of healthcare ecosystems, information & analytics – we don’t need a healthcare expert as we’ll have others who can provide deep industry expertise, but general knowledge of the data sources, types, nomenclature, etc is important. This kind of knowledge often comes with 2-5 years of experience in healthcare but can be shown with other strong HCLS examples. We’re expecting this role to quickly address such problems such as market analyses, risk stratification, & operational efficiency, and move on to problems in clinical efficacy and healthcare quality metrics. We’d love to hear what you’ve done in similar areas, and where you’re looking to expand. \\nAdvanced SQL, analytics, and statistical background – someone who can understand the math and help navigate alternative statistical strategies. Having projects where you’ve investigated alternative data sources and approaches, and discussing how you helped guide teams to a successful decision and results, are a great way to demonstrate the ability to go deep. \\nAdaptable willingness and ability to support the team and achieve results – someone who has shown themselves willing to jump into new areas, learn new technologies, and do so quickly in a way that impacts the business. Being able to discuss examples of having a measurable impact on the business and mastering new technologies would show how you are focused on making a difference for the team and the company. \\nKeeping things simple – someone who remains focused on simple, reliable solutions even when the problems seem complex. We’d love to hear precedents where you took something really complicated and were able solve it with something simple, or in a way that addressed an even bigger problem in a general, flexible way. \\n\\nAnd as potential bonus areas, we’re also interested to hear about your\\n\\nMore in-depth previous experience in healthcare or with healthcare informatics/analytics, demonstrating in-depth knowledge of healthcare industry and terminology \\nBreadth of data skills across the board with knowledge of infrastructures (in Snowflake, AWS), data modeling, reporting & visualizations, statistics/analytics, AI/ML, Jupyter notesbooks, etc – we’re still a small team and being able to demonstrate breadth of knowledge is as important as demonstrating depth. \\nA demonstrated ability to impact care quality and quality gaps – showing you can help quantify care quality or measure HEDIS/STARS metrics is a great benefit \\nHistory of automating data, analytics, and AI/ML pipelines to improve developer reliability, speed, and quality. \\n\\nOur Investors\\n\\nDiverge Health is funded by GV and incubated by Triple Aim Partners, which since 2019 has partnered with entrepreneurs to co-found and launch eight companies focused on improving the quality, experience and total cost of healthcare.\\n\\nAt Diverge Health we believe that a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences enrich our teams and enable us to realize our mission.
